% Help for the Identify Primary Adaptive Threshold B module: 
% Category: Object Identification
%
% This image analysis module identifies objects by applying an
% adaptive threshold to a grayscale image.  Four different methods
% (A,B,C, and D) of adaptive thresholding can be used to identify
% objects.  Applies a local threshold at each pixel across the image
% and then identifies objects which are not touching. Provides more
% accurate edge determination and slightly better separation of clumps
% and than a simple threshold; still, it is ideal for well-separated
% nuclei.
%
% Method B: the optimal thresholds are determined by averaging
% intensities and multiplying by an offset, within the neighborhood of
% every pixel.
%
% NEIGHBORHOOD SIZE: should be set large enough that every square
% block of pixels is likely to contain some background and some
% foreground. Smaller neighborhood sizes take less processing time.
%
% What does Primary mean? Identify Primary modules identify objects
% without relying on any information other than a single grayscale
% input image (e.g. nuclei are typically primary objects). Identify
% Secondary modules require a grayscale image plus an image where
% primary objects have already been identified, because the secondary
% objects' locations are determined in part based on the primary
% objects (e.g. cells can be secondary objects). Identify Tertiary
% modules require images where two sets of objects have already been
% identified (e.g. nuclei and cell regions are used to define the
% cytoplasm objects, which are tertiary objects).
%
% SAVING IMAGES: This module produces several images which can be
% easily saved using the Save Images module. These will be grayscale
% images where each object is a different intensity. (1) The
% preliminary segmented image, which includes objects on the edge of the image and
% objects that are outside the size range can be saved using the name:
% PrelimSegmented + whatever you called the objects (e.g.
% PrelimSegmentedNuclei). (2) The preliminary segmented image which
% excludes objects smaller than your selected size range can be saved
% using the name: PrelimSmallSegmented + whatever you called the
% objects (e.g. PrelimSmallSegmented Nuclei) (3) The final segmented
% image which excludes objects on the edge of the image and excludes
% objects outside the size range can be saved using the name:
% Segmented + whatever you called the objects (e.g. SegmentedNuclei)
% 
% Several additional images are normally calculated for display only,
% including the colored label matrix image (the objects displayed as
% arbitrary colors), object outlines, and object outlines overlaid on
% the original image. These images can be saved by altering the code
% for this module to save those images to the handles structure (see
% the SaveImages module help) and then using the Save Images module.
% Important note: The calculations of these display images are only
% performed if the figure window is open, so the figure window must be
% left open or the Save Images module will fail.  If you are running
% the job on a cluster, figure windows are not open, so the Save
% Images module will also fail, unless you go into the code for this
% module and remove the 'if/end' statement surrounding the DISPLAY
% RESULTS section.

% PROGRAMMING NOTE
% HELP:
% The first unbroken block of lines will be extracted as help by
% CellProfiler's 'Help for this analysis module' button as well as
% Matlab's built in 'help' and 'doc' functions at the command line. It
% will also be used to automatically generate a manual page for the
% module. An example image demonstrating the function of the module
% can also be saved in tif format, using the same name as the
% algorithm (minus Alg), and it will automatically be included in the
% manual page as well.  Follow the convention of purpose of the
% module, description of the variables and acceptable range for each,
% how it works (technical description), info on which images can be 
% saved, and See also CAPITALLETTEROTHERALGORITHMS. The license/author
% information should be separated from the help lines with a blank
% line so that it does not show up in the help displays.

% PROGRAMMING NOTE
% DRAWNOW:
% The 'drawnow' function allows figure windows to be updated and
% buttons to be pushed (like the pause, cancel, help, and view
% buttons).  The 'drawnow' function is sprinkled throughout the code
% so there are plenty of breaks where the figure windows/buttons can
% be interacted with.  This does theoretically slow the computation
% somewhat, so it might be reasonable to remove most of these lines
% when running jobs on a cluster where speed is important.

%%% VARIABLES %%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
drawnow 

% PROGRAMMING NOTE
% VARIABLE BOXES AND TEXT: 
% The '%textVAR' lines contain the text which is displayed in the GUI
% next to each variable box. The '%defaultVAR' lines contain the
% default values which are displayed in the variable boxes when the
% user loads the algorithm. The line of code after the textVAR and
% defaultVAR extracts the value that the user has entered from the
% handles structure and saves it as a variable in the workspace of
% this algorithm with a descriptive name. The syntax is important for
% the %textVAR and %defaultVAR lines: be sure there is a space before
% and after the equals sign and also that the capitalization is as
% shown.  Don't allow the text to wrap around to another line; the
% second line will not be displayed.  If you need more space to
% describe a variable, you can refer the user to the help file, or you
% can put text in the %textVAR line above or below the one of
% interest, and do not include a %defaultVAR line so that the variable
% edit box for that variable will not be displayed; the text will
% still be displayed. CellProfiler is currently being restructured to
% handle more than 11 variable boxes. Keep in mind that you can have
% several inputs into the same box: for example, a box could be
% designed to receive two numbers separated by a comma, as long as you
% write a little extraction algorithm that separates the input into
% two distinct variables.  Any extraction algorithms like this should
% be within the VARIABLES section of the code, at the end.

% PROGRAMMING NOTE
% DRAWNOW BEFORE FIGURE COMMAND:
% The "drawnow" function executes any pending figure window-related
% commands.  In general, Matlab does not update figure windows until
% breaks between image analysis modules, or when a few select commands
% are used. "figure" and "drawnow" are two of the commands that allow
% Matlab to pause and carry out any pending figure window- related
% commands (like zooming, or pressing timer pause or cancel buttons or
% pressing a help button.)  If the drawnow command is not used
% immediately prior to the figure(ThisAlgFigureNumber) line, then
% immediately after the figure line executes, the other commands that
% have been waiting are executed in the other windows.  Then, when
% Matlab returns to this module and goes to the subplot line, the
% figure which is active is not necessarily the correct one. This
% results in strange things like the subplots appearing in the timer
% window or in the wrong figure window, or in help dialog boxes.

%%% SAVE DATA TO HANDLES STRUCTURE %%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
drawnow

% PROGRAMMING NOTE
% HANDLES STRUCTURE:
% In CellProfiler (and Matlab in general), each independent function
% (module) has its own workspace and is not able to 'see' variables
% produced by other modules. For data or images to be shared from one
% module to the next, they must be saved to what is called the
% 'handles structure'. This is a variable of class structure which is
% called handles. Data which should be saved to the handles structure
% within each module includes: any images, data or measurements which
% are to be eventually saved to the hard drive (either in an output
% file, or using the SaveImages module) or which must be used by a
% later module in the analysis pipeline. It is important to think
% about which of these data should be deleted at the end of an
% analysis run because of the way Matlab saves variables: For example,
% a user might process 12 image sets of nuclei which results in a set
% of 12 measurements ("TotalNucArea") stored in the handles structure.
% In addition, a processed image of nuclei from the last image set is
% left in the handles structure ("SegmNucImg").  Now, if the user uses
% a different algorithm which happens to have the same measurement
% output name "TotalNucArea" to analyze 4 image sets, the 4
% measurements will overwrite the first 4 measurements of the previous
% analysis, but the remaining 8 measurements will still be present.
% So, the user will end up with 12 measurements from the 4 sets.
% Another potential problem is that if, in the second analysis run,
% the user runs only an algorithm which depends on the output
% "SegmNucImg" but does not run an algorithm that produces an image by
% that name, the algorithm will run just fine: it will just repeatedly
% use the processed image of nuclei leftover from the last image set,
% which was left in the handles structure ("SegmNucImg").
%
% INCLUDE FURTHER DESCRIPTION OF MEASUREMENTS PER CELL AND PER IMAGE
% HERE>>>
%
% The data extraction functions of CellProfiler are designed to deal
% with only one "column" of data per named measurement field. So, for
% example, instead of creating a field of XY locations stored in
% pairs, it is better to store a field of X locations and a field of Y
% locations.
